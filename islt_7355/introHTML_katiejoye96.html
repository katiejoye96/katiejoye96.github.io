Hey all! My name is Katie Whalen. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I know live and work in Kansas City for Cerner Corporations, who was recently acquired by Oracle. I am a Senior Learning Consultant for the Department of Defense client. I am working towards my MS in Learning Technologies and Design, and I will graduate in May 2023. I have used other website creation tools, such as Google and Wix, to create websites but never from scratch. I hope to learn more about the basics of creating a website, so I can continue to utilize my website building skill. My favorite thing to do in my free time is read or spend time with my three cats.
